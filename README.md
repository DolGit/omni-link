# OmniLink

React component that either creates an internal link with `React-Router Link` or an external link with the regular anchor tag. The differentiator is the props (properties) that are received. `Href` creates an external link, while `to` creates an internal link. This component accepts `href` and `to` props, as well as a link object that may contain either.
